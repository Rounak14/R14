## Checkbalance
This is code to check a expression "algebraic" is balanced or not.
I have used the concept of stack here and each time a closing bracket is invoked it just pop out the relative opening bracket if correct match is don then balanced else not balanced.

## Evaluate
this is code to generate postfix of a expression and evaluating the vallue of the given algebraic expression.
