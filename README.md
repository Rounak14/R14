## Checkbalance
This is code to check a expression "algebraic" is balanced or not.
I have used the concept of stack here and each time a closing bracket is invoked it just pop out the relative opening bracket if correct match is don then balanced else not balanced.
## Graph
Folder containg Codes for graph (data structure) resulting its BFS and DFS.
## AVL
Implemented AVL tree(self balanced tree) with rotate right, rotate left,rotate right then left and rotate left then right fucntions for the proper functioning of the code!
## Evaluate
this is code to generate postfix of a expression and evaluating the vallue of the given algebraic expression.
## Intersection
this is the code to create a linked list obtained from intersection of two different linked lists.
## Bubblesort
Code to bubble sort an array of user prompt sized.
## Insertionsort
Code to sort an user prompt sized array using Insertion sort method.
## Sortalgo
useful Sorting codes available such as merge sort,quick sort,selection sort etc.
